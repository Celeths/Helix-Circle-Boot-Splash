# Weaving Helix Ring Splashscreen
A splashscreen based of a weaving helix circle looping animation. The splashscreen is a simple looping 450x450px gif centered in the screen with a solid background.

There is a **dark and light** (inverted dark) version. There is also a currently unnused transparent version in the main Preview folder.

This was originally built for KDE Plasma 6, but I am trying to make it fairly universal.
